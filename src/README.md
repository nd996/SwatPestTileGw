SWAT development (e.g., pest routing through tiles and groundwater, ...)

## 16 Oct 2018

* Routing pesticides through tiles
* Routing pesticides through shallow groundwater.

## 03 Dec 2018
Upgraded to SWAT 2018, rev 670
* Decided to not use the 'Jane' version because to many changes in the core subsurface hydrology routines are needed. 
* Using the TFA-Version with the orignial SWAT subsurface routines. 
* Added pesticide transport via tiles, and shallow and depp groundwater flow.
* Sediment bound pesticide transport via lateral and tile flow need to be added.
